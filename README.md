# Flutter Camera App

![Demo](demo.gif)

A simple camera app using Flutter. It will be able to take still photos and record videos - with all controls available - from all devices cameras.

Still a work in progress. More details incoming.

## Run Demo

Clone the repo, install all dependancies `flutter pub get` and run `flutter run`. Make sure you have flutter [installed](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Help Needed

I need some help testing on iOS.
